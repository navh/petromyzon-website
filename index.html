                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are developing technology to capture the most accurate models of underwater structures.</p>
                <p>Pairing Sonar with neuromorphic hardware enables AI workloads to be run as close to the sensor as
                    possible. This offers higher bandwidth, more signal, less noise, and lower power consumption.
                    By running networks that can Detect, Locate, Classify, and Track underwater contacts we create a
                    real-time 3D model of the underwater environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Toronto's proximity to the St. Lawrence Seaway gives us access to a wide range of underwater
                    structures in fresh water for testing and development.

                <p><b>Murat Isik</b> received his B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Turkey in
                    2021, followed by an M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Drexel University,
                    Philadelphia, USA, in 2023.
                    He is currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, focusing on energy
                    estimation projects and their applications. He also holds a research scholarship at SLAC National
                    Accelerator Laboratory, where he continues his work on energy estimation. His contributions to
                    academia include awards from organizations such as IEEE, APS, ACM, Foresight, and the Howard Brain
                    Science Foundation. Along with an extensive portfolio of published research, Murat's interests lie
                    in Neuromorphic Hardware and the development of novel architectures for machine learning
                    acceleration. His work has earned recognition from institutions like the NSF and DOE, as well as
                    grant support for his innovative research.
                </p>
                <p><b>Amos Hebb</b> received his B.Eng. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from
                    the Royal Military College of Canada in 2019, with a capstone project using neural networks for
                    sensor fusion in a SLAM pipeline, and an M.A.Sc. in Electrical and Computer
                    Engineering from the University of Toronto, focusing on scheduling of mixed sensors for searching
                    and tracking targets with reinforcement learning.
                    He has operational experience on CP-140, Boeing P-8, and Kawasaki P-1.
                    He runs underwater photogrammetry courses and dives year round in Lake Ontario and the Bay of Fundy.
